# Pok√©mon List App

There are ton of these around, but this one is mine.
Practicing React, using API's and libraries.
Data fetched from PokeAPI, libraries used:

- MUI
- Axios
- Redux
- Emotion

To-do:

- ~~pages~~
- ~~popup modal~~
- ~~shiny variations~~
- regions
- types
- filter by region, types
- favorites? using [MUI bottom navigation](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-bottom-navigation/)
- abilities
- ~~change or display larger pics in modal~~
- scrollable overflow for content inside modal

Later on port to [React native](https://reactnative.dev), to make a mobile app.
